Hello,

My name is Chris and I graduated from Boston University in September 2021 with a Master's of Science in Software Development. 
I'm actively searhing for a full time position as a software engineer. 
I'm most interested in working with databases (both relational and non-relational) and cloud technologies.
I am currently teaching myself Git and about Amazon Web Services (AWS).
